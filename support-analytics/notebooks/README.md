# Notebooks

- `00_exploration.ipynb` *(create when needed)* – start here for ad-hoc analysis.
- `01_powerbi_export.ipynb` – optional helper for shaping datasets before publishing to Power BI.

> The repo keeps notebooks light on purpose. Use `jupyter lab` from the project root once the `requirements.txt` packages are installed. Notebooks are ignored from automated tests, so keep business logic in the ETL + API packages.
